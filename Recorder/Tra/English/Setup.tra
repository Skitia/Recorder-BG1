@4    = ~lorekeeper~
@5    = ~Lorekeeper~
@6    = ~LOREKEEPER: Lorekeepers are bards that focus less on a generalist skill set and lean more towards spell casting, where their prodigious memory and knowledge makes them better casters than most other bards. They make excellent librarians, historians, and advisors with their large capacity for learning and recalling, and their innate skills ensure information is not lost.

Advantages:
- +20 bonus to lore.
- +2 Spell Slots for every spell level. 
- May use SONATA in place of the regular Bard Song.

SONATA: This song provides varying levels of intelligence, save bonuses, and mind protection depending on the level of the bard:

Level 1: +1 Int, +1 Saves vs Spells, Immunity to Charm and Sleep. 
Level 15: +2 Int, +2 Saves vs Spells, Immunity to Charm, Sleep, and Rigid/Feeblemind.
Level 20: +3 Int, +3 Saves vs Spells, Immunity to Charm, Sleep, Rigid/Feeblemind and Confusion

Disadvantages:
- No Pickpocketing Skill.
- Can only be proficient in club, dagger, crossbow, and quarterstaff.~
@7    = ~Symphony of Scholars~
@8    = ~Symphony of Scholars: A powerful song unique to lorekeepers, the song gives the bard a 6 point bonus to their AC, and 10% magic resistance due to the magic of the song. As well, the bardâ€™s party receives +4 Intelligence, +2 to all saves, +5% MR, +15% chance of a critical hit, and immunity to charm, domination, sleep, rigid/feeblemind, confusion, and fear. 
This ability replaces the current bard song. It does not stack with Sonata, Enhanced Bard Song or other song sources, and cannot be learned if Enhanced Bard Song is known.

I know you are planning to march out with the Dragonspear Expedition. I worry that the battles to come may take you away from this world as it did my brother.
I've not even permitted my husband to take arms, as much as he desired. Please take care of yourself, and write back if you can, so we know you are all right.

Cindy Harmon.~
@22   = ~Recorder,

I know you are planning to march out with the Dragonspear Expedition. I just wish to say I am sorry for the things I said when you visited us and told us what happened with Mark.
I should have never said those things, and now I worry that the battles to come may take away his friend from this world as well. Please accept my forgiveness, and take care of yourself. 
Write back if you can

Cindy Harmon.~
@23   = ~Recorder's Letter~
@24   = ~Cindy,

Thank you for your letter. I have been well so far and seen so much. I can't wait to bring back stories of all I have been through. 
I am even traveling with the Hero of Baldur's Gate, who I have wrote so much about. I truly think that the history that is forged here will really impact the region for years to come.
I promise I'll do all I can to make it through this, and stop by and say hi again.

Recorder.~
@25   = ~Cindy,

Your apology means so much to me. I was truly stricken when you said those things, your brother was a dear friend and losing him was one of the hardest things that happened to me.
I think he would be happy for me, I'm trying to make a difference, and am even traveling with the great Hero of Baldur's Gate.
I hope we can talk when I return from this, for I do not want our last meeting to be one of tension and anger.

@37   = ~Expedition Leader's Journal~
@38   = ~Damn Milil Paladins. Mark and the bard accompanying him, Recorder were an hour behind. Knowing Mark, he probably found some beautiful woman he just had to help. Hopefully he wasn't badly conned like before.

I've assembled a small group of mercenaries, a mage named Rick Harris, my beloved Ruby, and Bryce and Hawk. Bryce and Hawk seem all right, but Ruby insists there's something not right with Rick. She keeps complaining of him going off when we rest on his own, not contributing to battles. I get he is shady, but he is the only real mage we have, excluding the bard with Mark, he is our best scholar. What can he do with five others anyway?

She'll calm down once this is over. The Temple will definitely appreciate some new lost tomes from this place, if they are there like that adventurer muttered about.~
@39   = ~Rick Harris's Journal~
@40   = ~This expedition has gathered outside the Ulcaster school and plans to set inside in the morning. I have no intention of waiting. This is my opportunity. I can slip in, set up some traps, and then all the lost spells and tomes will be mine to convene. I could even set up a few traps and return before they stir. 

This was completely worth turning down the assassination offer on <CHARNAME>. I might even go back to them and take it up after playing with my new knowledge. It would be nice to practice obliterating new foes after I am done with this expedition.~

@42   = ~When asked about her past, Recorder grows quiet for a moment.

She says little of what brought her north, only that where history is being made, it must be observed before it is lost.
